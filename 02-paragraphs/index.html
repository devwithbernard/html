            <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify">Social media are interactive technologies
                that facilitate the creation and sharing of content, ideas,
                interests, and other forms of expression through virtual communities and networks. While challenges
                to the definition of social media arise due to the variety of stand-alone and built-in social media
                services currently available, there are some common features.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify">The term social in regard to media suggests that
                    platforms
                    are
                    user-centric and
                    enable communal
                    activity.
                    As such, social media can be viewed as online facilitators or enhancers of human networksâ€”webs of individuals who enhance social connectivity.</p>

                    Users usually access social media services through web-based apps on desktops or download services that offer social media functionality
                    to their mobile devices (e.g. smartphones and tablets). As users engage with these electronic services, they create highly interactive platforms in which individuals, communities, and organizations can share, co-create, discuss, participate, and modify user-generated or self-curated content posted online.[9][7][1] Additionally, social media are used to document memories, learn about and explore things, advertise oneself, and form friendships along with the growth of ideas from the creation of blogs, podcasts, videos, and gaming sites.[10] This changing relationship between humans and technology is the focus of the emerging field of technological self-studies.[11] Some of the most popular social media websites, with more than 100 million registered users, include Twitter, Facebook (and its associated Messenger), WeChat, ShareChat, Instagram, QZone, Weibo, VK, Tumblr, Baidu Tieba, and LinkedIn. Depending on interpretation, other popular platforms that are sometimes referred to as social media services include YouTube, QQ, Quora, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, LINE, Snapchat, Pinterest, Viber, Reddit, Discord, TikTok, Microsoft Teams, and more. Wikis are examples of collaborative content creation.</p>
