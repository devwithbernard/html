                    It was not until the era of the ancient Greeks that we have any record of how people tried to explain
                    the chemical changes they observed and used. At that time, natural objects were thought to consist of
                    only four basic elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Then, in the <b><em style="color: brown">fourth
                    century</em></b> BC,
                    two Greek philosophers,
                    Democritus and Leucippus, suggested that matter was not infinitely divisible into smaller particles but instead
                     consisted of fundamental, indivisible particles called <strong>atoms</strong>. Unfortunately, these early
                    philosophers did not have the technology to test their hypothesis. They would have been unlikely to
                    do so in any case because the ancient Greeks did not conduct experiments or use the scientific method.
                    They believed that the nature of the universe could be discovered by rational thought alone.

                    The 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries saw the beginnings of what we now recognize as
                    modern chemistry. During this period, great advances were made in <mark>metallurgy</mark>, the extraction of metals
                    from ores, and the
                    first systematic quantitative experiments were carried out. In 1661, the Englishman Robert Boyle
                    (<small>1627â€“91</small>) published The Sceptical Chymist, which described the relationship between the pressure and
                    the volume of air. More important, Boyle defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into two or more simpler substances by chemical means. This led to the identification of a large number of elements, many of which were metals. Ironically, Boyle himself never thought that metals were elements.
